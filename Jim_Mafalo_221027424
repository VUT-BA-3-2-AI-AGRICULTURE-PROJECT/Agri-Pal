Create crop disease detection model:
Linear Regression- Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable (such as crop yield) based on one or more input features (like weather conditions, soil properties, etc.). It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. Linear regression is relatively simple to implement and provides interpretable results. It's a good starting point for yield prediction, especially when the relationships between features are approximately linear.
Decision Trees- This is a supervised learning model with the power of utilization in each class and solving a regression problem. It has a root-filled hierarchical tree structure, inner nodes, leaf nodes, and nodes. The decision tree operates by making the choice of the query as the basis node, and solely on the basis of the query, the tree is prolonged until the lowest degree of entropy is reached.
